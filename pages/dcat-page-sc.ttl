Concepts make clear which 'topics of conversation' exist. In a system catalog concepts are formally defined. Each definition is built according to strict rules. The essence is that every concept in a certain domain is explained in terms of other concepts. These concepts are also explained until finally every concept that needs some explanation is defined. At the end the concepts  whose meaning is taken for granted remain. In a logical model these are called axioms. This way an axiomatic conceptual framework is created for each domain. This conceptual framework can be regarded as a more or less formalized description of the institutional reality of the domain.
SKOS is used to describe concepts. SKOS is a standard on the appy-or-explain list for governments in the Netherlands.
* Every concept is represented by a skos:concept.
* Each domain has its own concept scheme. The concept scheme for a particular domain is represented by a skos:ConceptScheme.
* Concepts can be arranged in collections. A collection is represented by a skos:collection.
* Concepts in different domains can be linked via matching mechanisms. This connection of concepts between domains creates a system of coherent concept schemes. This system of coherent concepts schemes can be seen as the knowledge base for a system catalog.
